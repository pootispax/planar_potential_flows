\section{Functional requirement of the program}
\subsection{The project}
The goal of this project is to simulate the movement of a fluid through
different geometries. The program creates a box of a choosen size, builds a
geometry inside it and simulates the movement of a given fluid.

\subsection{Files}
In order to increase readability, the project is made of several files.
I made the choice to work with Object Oriented Programming.
\begin{itemize}
    \item main.py: This file calls for the needed functions/class
    \item matrices.py: This file contains the class ``Matrices'', it builds the
          geometry, the different matrices to plot and stores them
    \item plot.py: This file plots the matrices built in ``matrices.py''
    \item parameters.py: This file contains all the variables that can be 
          changed by the user
    \item data\_check.py: This file checks the variables and makes sure that
          the program will run
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data}
This project uses several piece of data set by the user to work.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_x \text{ and } N_y$ are the size of the domain
    \item $h$ represents the size of a cell
    \item $geometry$ corresponds to the choosen geometry
    \item $angle$ corresponds to the angle of the widening/shrinkage geometry
    \item $v_x$ is the Neuman condition
    \item $\phi_{ref}$ is the Dirichlet condition
\end{itemize}
Be careful in the case of a widening/shrinkage geometry !
In order for the program to generate a domain from one end to another, there is
a restriction on the angle, if the restriction is not met, the program will
output a ValueError. The restriction is as follows:
\[
      |angle| < \arctan{\left(\dfrac{0.5 \times N_y - 1}{N_x}\right)}
\]
The angle parameter should be set in degree, the program will convert it to
radians for the computation.

\subsection{Outputs}
As of the alpha version, the program outputs 4 pdf files, one for each plot.
The files are saved in a subfolder named ``figures'' and the filenames are set
with the following rule:\\
\begin{center}
      \mintinline{python}{<data>_<geometry>_Nx=<Nx>_Ny=<Ny>.pdf}
\end{center}
\mintinline{python}{data} stands for the plotted data (potential, velocity,
streamlines, pressure).
\subsection{Concerning the running time}
Due to the function \mintinline{python}{numpy.linalg.solve()} being slow for
big matrices, the bigger the size of the domain, the higher the running time.\\
For a domain size of $\num{3600}$ cells ($\num{60} \times \num{60}$), it takes
around $\num{20}$ seconds to run, for a domain size of $\num{14400}$ cells
($\num{120} \times \num{120}$), it increases to $\num{23}$ minuts. 
\smallbreak
I searched for a faster method to solve the linear system in vain, thus I
recommend to stay on relatively low values for $N_x$ and $N_y$, the graphs are
easily readable for a value of $\num{60}$ each.\\

\section{Internal structure of the program}
\subsection{Physical model}
In order to build the model, the program uses a squared structured lattice
model (matrix). The values are computed at each point of the matrix.
